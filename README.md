This lab focused on setting up a web development environment, learning version control with Git, and using GitHub for collaboration. We installed VS Code, Git, and Node.js, created a simple HTML page, and pushed it to GitHub. Additionally, we practiced Git workflow tasks such as creating branches, making commits, merging changes via pull requests, and collaborating with a teammate through forking and pull requests. This lab provided hands-on experience with essential tools for web development and version control.
