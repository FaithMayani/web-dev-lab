In this lab, I learned how to set up a web development environment, create a basic webpage, and use Git & GitHub for version control. 
I installed VS Code, Git, and Node.js, then verified their installations then I created a simple HTML file, opened it in a browser, and used Live Server for real-time updates.
I configured Git, initialized a repository, and pushed my project to GitHub.
Additionally, I worked with branches by creating a feature branch, adding a new file, and merging it through a pull request. 
I also practiced collaboration by forking a teammateâ€™s repository, making contributions, and submitting a pull request.
This lab provided me with valuable hands-on experience in GitHub workflows and essential web development tools.
